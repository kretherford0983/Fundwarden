# Backup and restore (since 1.4.1)

Administrators create and restore backups on **System/About → Backup / Restore**. A new installation can also be
set up from a backup in the **initialization wizard** ("Restore from a backup instead").

## What a backup contains

| Included | Not included |
|---|---|
| The database: organization, users and their password hashes, roles, two-step verification (authenticator secrets, recovery codes), every financial record, the audit log | `config.toml` (server settings: bind address, port, proxy, cookies) |
| Every attachment | Logs, the `pre-restore/` safety copy, temporary work files |
| The portable encryption key (`secrets/`) — needed to read bank account numbers and authenticator secrets | |

A backup is a single file `pennywarden-backup-<organization>-<date>-<time>.fmbak` (1.6.6 to 1.6.8:
`fundwarden-backup-…`; before 1.6.6:
`freedger-backup-…` — those files restore exactly as before).

## Encryption

The file is encrypted with a **passphrase you choose** (at least 12 characters): AES-256-GCM in 1 MiB authenticated
records, key derived with scrypt (N = 2^15, r = 8, p = 1). Record order, the end of the file and the header are
authenticated, so a changed, reordered or shortened file is refused. **Without the passphrase the backup cannot be
restored** — nobody (including the application) can recover a lost passphrase. Keep the passphrase in a password
manager and the backup file away from the server.

## Creating a backup

System/About → Backup / Restore → **Backup**: passphrase twice + your own password → **Create backup**. The database
is copied with SQLite's online backup API, so users can keep working. The download starts automatically; the file
stays downloadable from that page for one hour and is then deleted from the server's work folder.

## Restoring

System/About → Backup / Restore → **Restore**: choose the `.fmbak` file, enter its passphrase, your password and type
`RESTORE`. The file is uploaded in 20 MB parts (so large backups pass Cloudflare Tunnel's 100 MB request limit;
an interrupted part is retried). The page then shows each step:

1. Decrypting and checking the backup (passphrase, integrity, every file against the manifest)
2. Checking versions and the encryption key — a backup from a **newer** version is refused (upgrade the
   application first); a backup from an older 1.4.1+ version is migrated forward
3. Pausing the application (other requests get "restore in progress" for a few seconds)
4. Saving a safety copy of the current data — moved to `pre-restore/` in the data directory (only the latest copy
   is kept)
5. Updating the database to this version
6. Restarting the application — the database and key are reopened inside the running service (no process restart,
   works the same on Windows, systemd and Docker)

Everyone is signed out (all sessions and trusted browsers are revoked). Sign in with an account **from the backup**;
two-step verification continues with the authenticator from the backup. The restore is recorded in the restored audit
log as `SYSTEM_RESTORED`.

If any step fails the current data stays in place (or is put back from the safety copy) and the page says which step
failed. The largest accepted file is set by `restore_max_mb` in `config.toml` (default 20480).

## Scheduled backups (since 1.9.0)

System/About → Backup / Restore → **Scheduled** writes backups on its own, without anyone signed in:

- **Schedule:** Daily at a time, or Weekly on a day at a time — the computer's (server's) local time.
- **Folder:** one folder the operating system running PennyWarden can already see: a local folder, an external drive
  or a mounted network share. On a **server** the server owner lists the allowed folders in `config.toml`
  (`backup_folders = ["/mnt/nas/pennywarden"]`, docs/configuration.md) and the Administrator picks one; the service
  account (`pennywarden` on Linux) must be able to write there. On a **local install** any folder can be entered.
  **Test** writes and removes a small file to check the folder. Copying backups offsite is done outside PennyWarden.
- **Passphrase and key pair:** the Administrator sets a backup passphrase once (at least 12 characters; their own
  password confirms it). PennyWarden turns it into a key pair and keeps only the public key and the private key
  locked with the passphrase — it can **lock** each backup but cannot open one. Each file is encrypted like a manual
  backup (AES-256-GCM records) with its own random key, which is locked for the public key (X25519 + HKDF-SHA256);
  the locked private key travels in the file header, so the **passphrase alone restores it anywhere** through the
  normal **Restore** tab. Changing the passphrase makes a new key pair: backups made before still need the earlier
  passphrase. A forgotten passphrase cannot be recovered.
- **Keep:** Daily schedule — how many daily, weekly (the first backup of each week) and monthly (the first backup of
  each month) backups to keep, e.g. 3 / 2 / 2; Weekly schedule — weekly and monthly only. The newest backup is always
  kept. Older ones are deleted after each successful backup — **only files PennyWarden wrote and recorded in its
  history, never anything else in the folder**.
- **Failures:** a failed backup is tried again after 1 hour, then 2, 4, 8 … hours (at most 24) so failing hardware
  is not hammered; the next scheduled backup runs at its normal time regardless and starts the sequence again.
  Administrators see a red banner on every page until the next backup succeeds.
- **Missed:** if PennyWarden was not running at the scheduled time, the backup runs about a minute after the next
  start.
- **Run now** writes a backup immediately; the page lists the recent runs with their result, file and size. Settings
  changes, runs, failures and deletions are in the audit log (`BACKUP_SCHEDULE_UPDATED`, `BACKUP_PASSPHRASE_SET`,
  `SCHEDULED_BACKUP_CREATED/FAILED/DELETED`).

## Moving to another server

On the new server install the same or a newer version, open it in the browser and choose **Restore from a backup
instead** in the initialization wizard (anyone who can reach an uninitialized installation can do this — the same as
running the wizard). The new server keeps its own `config.toml`.

## Manual recovery without the application

The files can also be copied by hand while the service is stopped: `database/`, `attachments/` and `secrets/` from
the data directory (`/var/lib/pennywarden` on a Linux server). The installer's automatic snapshots before each upgrade
(`/var/backups/pennywarden/<timestamp>/`) are such copies.
