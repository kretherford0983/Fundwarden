# What's new in 1.8 — quick guide

*1.8.0: budgets linked across Fiscal Years, the Financial Flow Report, a forgotten password reset with security
questions, and configuration notes for the Mac.*

## 1.8.0: the Financial Flow Report
**Reports → Financial Flow.** Enter a **Title** (e.g. "August 2026"), the **From Date**, and a **Through Date** — or
leave it empty for "Current" (today). Choose the account(s), and optionally **Include Bank Balances** with a
**Compare Date** (e.g. the date of your last report) and **Notes** to print on the report. Then **Review
transactions**.

The review shows every line of the report, one section per account:

- **Income** — every part of each deposit (a deposit from three donors is three lines); **Expenses** — one line per
  withdrawal. Uncleared transactions are included; transfers between your accounts and VOID transactions are not.
- **Uncheck** a line to leave it out of the report and its totals, for example a transfer that was entered as a
  withdrawal and a deposit. You are asked **why**; the reason is kept in the audit log with the report and is not
  printed. Checking the line again discards the reason.
- Type a **note** on a line to print it with that line. The transaction itself is not changed.

**Generate PDF** makes the report from the checked lines; **Open PDF** / **Download PDF** then show or save it. The
review is not saved — to keep a report, upload the PDF as a Fiscal Year document.

With **Include Bank Balances**, the report ends with the bank balance of every account on the Through Date (Checking,
Savings, Investments, Total Assets) and, with a Compare Date, each balance then and how much it grew or shrank.

## 1.8.0: budgets across Fiscal Years
A budget's ID or name sometimes changes from one year to the next. To keep track, open the budget's **Edit** dialog
(or create the budget) and choose in **Continues** the budget of an earlier year it carries on, e.g.
`FY2027 - 1000 - Operations`. The list offers budgets of the same type and level that no other budget continues yet.

- Budgets you **copy** into a new Fiscal Year are linked to their source for you.
- A budget with a link shows **History** next to its name on the Budgets page: every year of that budget with its
  ID, name, amount and actual, oldest first; the one you opened it from is highlighted.
- Choose **— None —** to remove a link. A locked budget is unlocked first, as for any other change.

## 1.8.0: configuration on a Mac
docs/configuration.md now has a section for the Mac: where the data folder and the log are
(`~/Library/Application Support/PennyWarden`, hidden in Finder — use **Go → Go to Folder…**), how to change settings
with `config.toml`, and how to start the app with options from Terminal.
