# Deployment

The same application and data model serve both **local** and **server** use on Windows and Linux (BR-082).
Native packages need no separately installed Python, Node.js, SQLite, Docker or database server (BR-083).

## Local installation (single user, loopback)

- **Windows (one file, since 1.5.0)**: download `PennyWarden-<version>-windows-x64.exe` from the GitHub release and
  double-click it. A console window shows the address and log — closing it stops PennyWarden. The .exe unpacks itself
  to a temporary folder at each start, so starting takes a few seconds. It is not code-signed: Windows SmartScreen may
  say "Windows protected your PC" — click **More info → Run anyway** (check the file against `SHA256SUMS.txt` from
  the same release first if you like: `Get-FileHash .\PennyWarden-<version>-windows-x64.exe`). Data is kept in
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\PennyWarden`, never inside the .exe, so replacing the .exe with a newer one keeps it.
  Server mode from a command prompt: `PennyWarden-<version>-windows-x64.exe --mode server`.
- **Mac with Apple Silicon (since 1.6.7)**: download `PennyWarden-<version>-macos-arm64.dmg` from the GitHub release,
  open it and drag **PennyWarden** onto **Applications**; then open PennyWarden from Applications. A small window
  shows the address and has **Open PennyWarden** and **Quit** — closing it stops PennyWarden. For M1 or later, macOS 11
  or later (not for Intel Macs). The app is signed "ad hoc" only — it is not signed with an Apple Developer ID and
  not notarized — so **the first start needs one confirmation**: macOS says *"PennyWarden" Not Opened — Apple could
  not verify…*; click **Done**, open **System Settings → Privacy & Security**, scroll to *Security* and click
  **Open Anyway** next to the PennyWarden line, then confirm. (macOS 14 and earlier: right-click the app →
  **Open** also works.) Step by step with pictures: [install-macos.md](install-macos.md). To check the download first: `shasum -a 256 PennyWarden-<version>-macos-arm64.dmg` against
  `SHA256SUMS.txt` from the same release. Data is kept in `~/Library/Application Support/PennyWarden`, never inside
  the app, so replacing the app with a newer one keeps it. To upgrade: quit PennyWarden, drag the new app onto
  Applications and choose *Replace*. Data folder, log, `config.toml` and options on a Mac:
  [configuration.md](configuration.md#on-a-mac). Server mode from Terminal:
  `/Applications/PennyWarden.app/Contents/MacOS/PennyWarden --mode server`.
- **Windows (portable folder)**: unzip `PennyWarden-windows-x64.zip` anywhere (e.g.
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs`), double-click `PennyWarden.cmd`.
- **Linux**: `tar xzf PennyWarden-linux-x64.tar.gz && ./pennywarden/pennywarden`

Startup applies pending Alembic migrations, binds to `127.0.0.1:8765`, waits for `/api/health`, and opens the
default browser when a desktop session is available. Plain HTTP is acceptable because traffic stays on loopback.

> **Data protection:** create encrypted backups regularly (System/About → Backup / Restore, since 1.4.1 — see
> docs/backup-restore.md) and keep them off this machine together with their passphrase.

## Server installation (multiple users)

### Linux: one command (since 1.5.0)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/kretherford0983/PennyWarden/releases/latest/download/install.sh | sudo bash
```

`install.sh` finds the release, downloads the Linux package, `install-server.sh` and `SHA256SUMS.txt` from it,
verifies the checksums and runs that release's `install-server.sh` (systemd service `pennywarden`, `/opt/pennywarden`,
data in `/var/lib/pennywarden`, a data snapshot before every upgrade, health check). The same command installs and
upgrades; `config.toml`, the key, the database and attachments are never replaced. An installation under an
earlier name (service `fundwarden`, 1.6.6 to 1.6.8; service `fmpoc`, before 1.6.6) is migrated to the new names by
the same command — see [upgrade.md](upgrade.md).

- **Which release:** by default the newest production release (1.6.6 was the first). `--channel test` installs the
  newest **test** pre-release instead (for a test server only); `--version <tag>` installs exactly that release:
  `curl -fsSL https://github.com/kretherford0983/PennyWarden/releases/download/<tag>/install.sh | sudo bash -s -- --version <tag>`
- **Port:** a new installation uses 8765 (`--port N` to change); an upgrade reads the port from the existing
  `config.toml`.
- **Prefer to read it first?**
  `curl -fsSLO https://github.com/kretherford0983/PennyWarden/releases/download/<tag>/install.sh`, read it, then
  `sudo bash install.sh --version <tag>`.

The manual way (copy the package and `install-server.sh` to the server, then
`sudo bash install-server.sh PennyWarden-linux-x64-portable.tar.gz`) still works.

### Any platform

```bash
pennywarden --mode server --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8765 --no-browser     # behind a local reverse proxy
```

Authenticated network use must be served over HTTPS (BR-090). The application does not obtain certificates;
terminate TLS in a reverse proxy and set `FM_SECURE_COOKIES=true`, `FM_HSTS=true`, and `FM_TRUSTED_PROXIES` to the
proxy address. Binding to a network interface without `secure_cookies=true` prints a prominent
**SECURITY WARNING** at startup and shows a banner in the UI; it is never represented as secure.

### Caddy
```
finance.example.org {
    reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:8765
}
```
### nginx
```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name finance.example.org;
    ssl_certificate     /etc/ssl/finance.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/finance.key;
    client_max_body_size 6m;
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8765;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto https;
    }
}
```
### Apache
```apache
<VirtualHost *:443>
  ServerName finance.example.org
  SSLEngine on
  SSLCertificateFile /etc/ssl/finance.crt
  SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/ssl/finance.key
  ProxyPreserveHost On
  RequestHeader set X-Forwarded-Proto "https"
  ProxyPass / http://127.0.0.1:8765/
  ProxyPassReverse / http://127.0.0.1:8765/
</VirtualHost>
```

Run as a service: systemd unit (`ExecStart=/opt/pennywarden/current/pennywarden --mode server --no-browser`,
`Environment=FM_DATA_DIR=/var/lib/pennywarden`, dedicated user) or on Windows with Task Scheduler/NSSM running
`PennyWarden-Server.cmd`. Run a single application process per data directory (SQLite + in-process
login rate limiter).

## Docker (optional)

```bash
docker build -f packaging/docker/Dockerfile -t pennywarden .
docker run -d -p 127.0.0.1:8765:8765 -v pennywarden-data:/data pennywarden
# or with automatic HTTPS:
docker compose -f packaging/docker/docker-compose.yml up -d     # edit Caddyfile host name first
```
Where a registry is unavailable, `packaging/docker/build_bundle_image.sh` builds an image from the self-contained
Linux bundle (this path was built and run during verification).

## Upgrades

See [upgrade.md](upgrade.md). In short: stop the application, replace the binaries, start it again. Alembic
migrations run automatically; databases are never dropped or recreated.

## Moving data between machines / operating systems (AC-DEP-006)

1. Stop the application.
2. Copy the whole application data directory (`database/`, `attachments/`, `secrets/`, optional `config.toml`).
3. Install a compatible or newer version on the target (Windows or Linux) and point `FM_DATA_DIR`/`--data-dir` at the copy.
4. Start: migrations run; encrypted account numbers decrypt with the portable key (plain JSON key file, no OS keystore).

On Windows, keep the data directory under the user profile (default `%LOCALAPPDATA%`) or restrict its ACL to the
service account, because POSIX `chmod 600` is not meaningful there.

## License

PennyWarden is free software under the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (`LICENSE`). Every package contains
`LICENSE` and `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.txt` (all bundled components and their licenses). The app links to its source code
(sign-in page, My Account, System/About) as AGPL section 13 requires. If you run a **modified** version for other
people, publish your changes and point `SOURCE_URL` in `backend/fmpoc/legal.py` at them.
