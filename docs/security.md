# Security controls and checks

| Area | Implementation | Verified by |
|---|---|---|
| Authentication | Argon2id (argon2-cffi defaults); constant-time dummy verify for unknown users; password policy ≥12 chars with letter+digit, ≠ username | `test_init_auth.py` |
| Sessions | Random 256-bit token in HttpOnly, SameSite=Strict cookie (`Secure` under HTTPS); only SHA-256 hash stored; rotated on login; revoked on logout, password change (other sessions), admin reset and user disable; idle 30 min / absolute 12 h | `test_ac_sec_006_*`, `test_ac_auth_self_*`, `test_disabled_user_*` |
| Authorization | Role→permission map (`fmpoc/permissions.py`) re-evaluated from the DB on every request; per-route `require(...)` dependencies; object lookups scoped to the caller's workspace (`get_scoped`); hidden `Multiple` entity returns 404 | `test_rbac.py`, `test_ac_sec_014_*` |
| CSRF | Global dependency: every non-GET `/api/` request needs `X-CSRF-Token` equal to the session token (pre-auth login/initialize use a double-submit token); cross-origin `Origin` rejected | `test_ac_sec_020_*` (enumerates every mutating route) |
| Input validation / mass assignment | Pydantic models with `extra="forbid"`, lengths, enums, patterns, date ranges; money parsed as ≤2-dp decimals with range limits | `test_ac_sec_012_*`, `test_ac_sec_013_*` |
| SQL | SQLAlchemy ORM/Core with bound parameters only; LIKE wildcards escaped; sort/direction/status via `Literal` allowlists | `test_ac_sec_009_*`, `test_ac_sec_010_*` |
| XSS | React escaped rendering only (no `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, checked by test); CSP `script-src 'self'` without inline | `test_ac_sec_011_*`, E2E `window.__xss` check |
| Attachments | Streaming 5 MB limit + 6 MB body limit; extension allowlist **and** content inspection (PDF header/trailer, Pillow-verified PNG/JPEG, types must agree); random 32-hex storage names under `attachments/`, `O_EXCL` writes; served with `nosniff` and attachment CSP | `test_ac_att_*`, `test_ac_sec_015/016/017_*` |
| Account numbers | AES-256-GCM (random nonce, AAD) + HMAC-SHA256 fingerprint for uniqueness; fixed 10-char mask; reveal = Budget Manager only, audited without the value, `Cache-Control: no-store` | `test_ac_bank_002_003_*`, `test_ac_sec_008_*` |
| Audit | Same DB transaction as the mutation (flush inside the unit of work); `before/after` sanitized (`SENSITIVE_KEYS`); SQLite triggers make `audit_event` append-only | `test_ac_aud_*` |
| Errors & logs | Generic JSON errors with correlation id; validation errors never echo input; engine `hide_parameters=True`; logs record method/path/status only, plus a redaction filter | `test_ac_sec_018_*`, `test_ac_aud_005_ac_sec_019_*` |
| Headers | `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`, CSP, `Permissions-Policy`, COOP/CORP, `Cache-Control: no-store` on API; HSTS when configured over HTTPS | `test_ac_sec_021_*` |
| Secure defaults | Loopback bind in local mode; no default credentials; debug/docs/openapi disabled; plain-HTTP network warning | `test_ac_sec_022_*`, `test_settings_local_mode_*` |
| OS commands | None — no `subprocess`/`os.system`/`eval` in application code | `test_ac_sec_023_*` (static scan) |

## Dependency vulnerability checks (AC-SEC-024)

Since 1.6.8 these checks also run **every week on `main`** (workflow `security`, a failure is emailed by GitHub) and
Dependabot proposes dependency updates into `develop` — see docs/branching.md, *Automatic checks between releases*.

```bash
. .venv/bin/activate
bash scripts/security_check.sh          # writes build/security/{pip-audit,npm-audit,security-tests}.txt
# individually:
pip-audit -r backend/requirements.txt
npm --prefix frontend audit
```

Results recorded for this run (2026-09-28): `pip-audit 2.10.1` — *No known vulnerabilities found*;
`npm 10.9.7 audit` — *found 0 vulnerabilities*. During development `npm audit` reported advisories for
`react-router-dom@6.x` and `vite@6.4.1`; they were remediated by removing the router dependency (a 60-line
History-API router is used instead) and pinning `vite@6.4.3`.

## v1.2.0 additions

| Area | Control | Verified by |
|---|---|---|
| Reports (PDF) | All user-controlled text XML-escaped before reportlab paragraph markup (blocks `<img src=…>`/markup injection); attachments read only via generated storage keys and verified against stored SHA-256; malformed PDFs replaced by a placeholder; temp files deleted after the response; available to financial roles and Auditors only (Administrator 403); generation audited | `test_v12_reports.py` |
| Reports (CSV) | Cells beginning with `= + - @` are prefixed with `'` (spreadsheet formula injection) | `test_cr002_entity_activity_report` |
| Transfers | `transaction.manage` + CSRF; request model forbids client-supplied descriptions/fields; object-scoped accounts; closed/non-register accounts refused; legs voided atomically | `test_v12_transfers.py` |
| v1.2.1 audit PDF | Attachment PDFs embedded via `pypdf.merge_transformed_page` only after parsing succeeds (encrypted/malformed → placeholder); images decoded by Pillow before drawing; all captions/fields still XML-escaped | `test_v12_reports.py` (incl. `test_cr002_attachments_rendered_within_letter_page_width`) |
| v1.2.1 allocation mark / transfer entity | `extra="forbid"` models; entity must be active and visible (422 otherwise); allocation mark changes audited | `test_v12_documentation.py`, `test_v12_transfers.py` |
| v1.3 duplicate protection | Request keys are random (browser CSPRNG), format-validated (16–64 `[A-Za-z0-9-]`), scoped per workspace and bound to the request kind; a replay only returns records the caller could already read. Check-number block enforced server-side | `test_v13_duplicates.py` |
| v1.3 new endpoints | `document-type` and `approval-no-attachment` need `fiscal_year.manage`; `void-check-number` and `check-review/acknowledge` need `transaction.manage`; all CSRF-protected (enumerated by `test_ac_sec_020_*`), audited, `extra="forbid"`; system-generated Close reports cannot be removed or re-typed | `test_v13_fy_documents.py`, `test_v13_missing_checks.py` |
| v1.3 UI preference | Collapsed-menu state stored server-side per user; the SPA still never uses browser storage | `test_no_localstorage_token_in_frontend`, `test_cr014_*` |
| New dependencies | reportlab 5.0.1, pypdf 6.19.0, charset-normalizer (pinned); `pip-audit`: no known vulnerabilities (2026-09-29); `npm audit`: 0 | `scripts/security_check.sh` |

## v1.4.1 additions

| Area | Control | Verified by |
|---|---|---|
| Two-step verification (CR-018) | TOTP (RFC 6238: 6 digits, 30 s, SHA-1, ±1 step) via `pyotp`; a step already accepted is refused (replay). Required for every user in **server mode**, optional in local mode. After the password the session is **MFA-pending**: no roles/permissions, 10-minute lifetime, only `/api/auth/me`, logout and the MFA endpoints work (`401 MFA_REQUIRED` elsewhere); on success the pending session is revoked and a new session token issued. Wrong codes count against the sign-in rate limiter (per user and IP) | `test_v141_mfa.py` |
| TOTP secret | AES-256-GCM with the portable key and its own AAD (`fmpoc:totp_secret:v1`), never logged or returned after setup; the setup QR code is generated server-side (`segno`, SVG data URI - no third-party service) | `test_secret_encrypted_at_rest_and_cli_reset` |
| Recovery codes | 10 × 60-bit codes (`XXXX-XXXX-XXXX`, no look-alike characters), shown once, stored as SHA-256, single use; replaced only by setting MFA up again | `test_sign_in_totp_replay_recovery_and_rate_limit` |
| Trusted browsers | Optional "trust this browser for 30 days": random token in an HttpOnly, SameSite=Strict cookie (`Secure` under HTTPS), only its SHA-256 stored; revoked by password change/reset, MFA change/reset/disable and from My Account | `test_trusted_browser_and_revocation`, `test_password_change_revokes_trusted_browsers` |
| Changing / resetting MFA | Changing the authenticator needs a current code or a recovery code. Administrator "Reset two-step" needs a reason and signs the user out everywhere; host command `pennywarden reset-mfa --user NAME` for a locked-out (sole) Administrator. All MFA events audited (`MFA_ENROLLED/CHANGED/FAILED/RECOVERY_CODE_USED/RESET/DISABLED/TRUSTED_BROWSER_*`); failed codes count in the admin dashboard's failed sign-ins | `test_admin_reset_and_user_enrollment`, `test_change_authenticator_needs_current_code` |
| Backup / restore (CR-023–025) | Backup file encrypted with a user passphrase: scrypt (N 2^15, r 8, p 1) → AES-256-GCM per 1 MiB record, nonce = random prefix + counter, AAD = header + record index + final flag (tampering, reordering, truncation and header changes detected). Administrator + password re-entry for backup and restore, typed `RESTORE`; before initialization restore is available like the wizard. Archive extraction allowlist + SHA-256 manifest check (no path traversal, no links); key must match the database; newer schema refused. Restored secrets folder reset to 0700/0600. All sessions/trusted browsers revoked after a restore; everything audited | `test_v141_backup.py` |
| New dependencies | pyotp 2.10.0, segno 1.6.6 (pure Python), recharts 3.10.1 (frontend); `pip-audit` and `npm audit`: no known vulnerabilities (2026-09-30) | `scripts/security_check.sh` |

## 1.8.0 additions

| Area | Control | Verified by |
|---|---|---|
| Security questions (#113) | Every user chooses 3 different questions from a fixed list at the first sign-in (existing users at the next one; after an Administrator's *Reset security questions*): the session stays pending (`QUESTIONS`: no roles or permissions, 15 minutes) until they are saved. Answers are normalized (Unicode NFKC, case-folded, letters and digits only) and hashed with Argon2id like passwords; never returned or logged. Changing them in My account needs the current password | `test_v180_forgot_password.py` |
| Forgot password (#113) | One of the user's questions at random, kept until a failed attempt or 15 minutes (refreshing does not offer another). In server mode - and in local mode when two-step verification is on - an authenticator code or a recovery code is also required (a recovery code is spent). Unknown, disabled or not-yet-set-up usernames get a question as well and always fail with the same message. Password rules apply; on success all sessions and trusted browsers are revoked, `PASSWORD_RESET_SELF_SERVICE` is audited with the method, the user is told at the next sign-in and Administrators get a notice | `test_local_reset_with_the_answer_alone`, `test_server_needs_a_code_and_spends_a_recovery_code`, `test_unknown_or_disabled_username_looks_the_same` |
| Failed attempts and lock-out (#113) | **Replaces the per-username in-memory limit for existing accounts**: one count per account of failed attempts in a row (wrong passwords at sign-in and wrong *Forgot password* answers/codes), stored in the database (survives restarts), reset by a successful sign-in or reset. Locks at 5 / 10 / 15 (15 min / 1 h / 24 h); during a lock attempts are refused (`429`, same message as the address brake) without checking the password. At 20 the account is disabled (`ACCOUNT_DISABLED_FAILED_ATTEMPTS`, security category). Administrators see a notice from the second lock on. Thresholds are settings (configuration.md). The in-memory limiter remains per client address and for unknown usernames | `test_escalating_locks_disable_and_notices`, `test_thresholds_from_the_settings`, `test_unknown_usernames_are_braked_like_accounts` |
| Way back in (#113) | An Administrator re-enables the account (clears the count) or resets the password / the questions (audited, reason required for the questions). Host commands `reset-password` (temporary password, must be changed at the next sign-in: session step `PASSWORD`) and `reset-mfa` also re-enable the account and clear the count; audited `via: host_cli` | `test_host_reset_password_and_reset_mfa_reenable`, `test_admin_reset_security_questions` |

Accepted trade-off (product owner, #113): someone who knows a username can fail 20 times to disable that account. It
takes more than a day because of the locks, Administrators are warned along the way and can re-enable it at once.
